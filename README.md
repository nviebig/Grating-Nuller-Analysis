### Semester Project: Grating Nuller

![Image]{img/SetUp.jpeg}

In this project, I am conducting a **theoretical analysis** of a **grating nuller**, an optical instrument used to suppress starlight and enhance high-contrast imaging capabilities for studying faint objects near bright sources, such as exoplanets.

This report analyzes the basic principles and mathematical foundations of a grating nuller, a device used for creating destructive interference in optical systems. It explains the conditions required for nulling with a diffraction grating and identifies the specific positions where nulling occurs. The report starts by analyzing the case of monochromatic light and provides an overview of the proposed experimental setup. This lays the foundation for understanding how grating nullers can be implemented and used in optical experiments.

The analysis includes:
- **Modeling the throughput performance** of the grating nuller using theoretical predictions.
- **Simulating the grating's behavior** with Python to visualize the nulling effect and calculate throughput.

By understanding the theoretical models, I aim to:
- Understand and optimize the grating nullerâ€™s efficiency and alignment.
- Contribute valuable insights to high-contrast imaging techniques in astrophysics.
